# 📝 **Loom Video Script - ELD Log Generator App Walkthrough**

**[Introduction - 30 seconds]**

"Hi everyone! I'm [Your Name], and today I'm going to walk you through the **ELD Log Generator** application I built using Django and React. This application helps truck drivers plan their trips according to the **FMCSA Hours of Service** regulations from the provided PDF document.

Let's start by exploring the key features and then dive into the code!"

---

## **Part 1: User Interface Demonstration (1 minute)**

### **Input Screen (0:00-0:30)**

"Here's the trip data input interface:
- **Current Location** - Where the driver starts
- **Pickup Location** - Where cargo is loaded
- **Dropoff Location** - Final destination
- **Current Cycle Used** - Hours already used in current cycle (0-70 hours)
- **Vehicle Weight** - Must be 10,001 lbs or more as per page 3 of the PDF

We're following these assumptions as specified:
1. Property-carrying driver, 70-hour/8-day schedule
2. No adverse driving conditions (unless specified)
3. Fueling every 1,000 miles
4. 1 hour for pickup and 1 hour for drop-off"

### **Results Screen (0:30-1:00)**

"After entering data and clicking **Generate ELD Logs**:
- **Interactive map** showing the route with fuel stops
- **Daily ELD logs** formatted exactly as shown on pages 15-19
- **Compliance check** against HOS regulations
- **Applicable exceptions** based on Appendix A"

## **Part 2: Code Walkthrough - Backend (1.5 minutes)**

### **Project Structure (1:00-1:30)**

"Let's look at the Django files in the `backend/` folder:

**`hos_calculator.py`** - The core logic:
```python
class HOSCalculator:
    # Implementing rules from pages 6-7:
    MAX_DAILY_DRIVING = 11      # §395.3(a)(3)
    MAX_DAILY_WINDOW = 14       # §395.3(a)(2)
    MIN_OFF_DUTY = 10           # §395.3(a)(1)
    BREAK_AFTER_HOURS = 8       # §395.3(a)(3)(ii)
    MAX_8DAY_HOURS = 70         # §395.3(b)
```

This code calculates:
1. 11-hour daily driving limit
2. 14-hour duty window
3. 30-minute break after 8 hours driving
4. 70-hour/8-day limit"

### **Exceptions Implementation (1:30-2:00)**

"**`exceptions.py`** - Manages exceptions from Appendix A:
- Short-haul exception (page 12)
- Adverse conditions exception (page 12)
- 16-hour exception (page 14)

```python
class ShortHaulException(HOSException):
    # Applies if trip is within 150 air miles
    # Benefits: No ELD required, no 30-minute break
```

**`views.py`** - Main API endpoint:
```python
class TripCalculatorView(APIView):
    def post(self, request):
        # 1. Check for applicable exceptions
        # 2. Calculate route
        # 3. Apply HOS rules
        # 4. Generate ELD logs
```

## **Part 3: Code Walkthrough - Frontend (1.5 minutes)**

### **React Components (2:00-2:30)**

"In the `frontend/src/components/` folder:

**`TripForm.js`** - Input form:
- Validates user input
- Shows helpful tooltips
- Submits data to backend

**`EldLogs.js`** - Displays ELD records:
```jsx
// Generates 24-hour timeline as shown on page 16
const timeline = activities.map(activity => ({
    status: activity.status,  // driving, on_duty, off_duty
    start: activity.start,
    end: activity.end
}));
```

**`MapView.js`** - Interactive map:
- Uses React-Leaflet for routing display
- Different markers for locations
- Fuel stop information"

### **Design and Visualization (2:30-3:00)**

"**`App.css`** - Responsive design:
- Grid layout for larger screens
- Mobile adaptation
- Color coding based on compliance status

**Charts** using Chart.js:
- Shows daily hour distribution
- Different colors for each status (driving, on-duty, off-duty)"

---

## **Part 4: Features and Compliance (1 minute)**

### **PDF Regulation Compliance (3:00-3:30)**

"The application implements **exactly** what's in the PDF:

1. **On-duty time definition** from page 5:
   - Driving, loading, waiting, maintenance

2. **Sleeper berth rules** from page 7:
   - 10 consecutive hours
   - Or 7+3 split configuration

3. **ELD record format** from pages 15-18:
   - 24-hour graph grid
   - Remarks section
   - Required signatures and information"

### **Generated Outputs (3:30-4:00)**

"The application produces:
1. **Printable ELD logs**
2. **Route map with stops**
3. **HOS compliance report**
4. **List of applicable exceptions**
5. **Legal references** from the PDF document"

## **[Closing - 30 seconds]**

"This application is **production-ready** and can be deployed to:
- **Vercel** for the frontend
- **Railway** or **PythonAnywhere** for the backend

The code is available on GitHub and includes:
✅ Complete documentation  
✅ Docker configuration  
✅ Tests  
✅ API with Swagger UI  

Thank you for watching! Any questions?"
